% Paper: "Nominal AC-Matching"
% 
% This is the top theory for the formalisation of a nominal AC-matching algorithm. 
% 
% Some proofs in this theory follow the same line of proofs in the theory of first-order AC-unification.
% However, the grammar of the terms is slightly different. Hence, reusing these
% proofs is done manually (it's interactive theorem proving not fully automated reasoning). 
%
% For the particular case of the theory of "nominal_AC_freshness", and
% "nominal_AC_fresh_subs" we reuse some proofs from the theory of nominal syntactic
% unification. Again, since the grammar of the terms is slightly different, the reuse
% of these proofs is done manually.
