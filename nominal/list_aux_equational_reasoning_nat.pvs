% Papers that use this theory: 
%   1. "Completeness in PVS of a Nominal Unification Algorithm"
%   2. "Formalising Nominal C-unification Generalised With Protected Variables"
%   3. "A Certified Algorithm for AC-Unification"
%   4. "Nominal AC-Matching"
%
% This subtheory does not receive a parameters and 
% contains very specific functions for dealing with lists of natural numbers in the
% context of equational reasoning (specially unification and matching). 
% 
% It differs from "list_aux_equational_reasoning" because it receives no parameters
% instead of only one.
